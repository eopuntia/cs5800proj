## Project specification: 

We will create a language for programming a set of 4 LED matrix panels to display text and simple animations. The panels are controlled by an Arduino and programmable with a C library called Protomatter. The panels are currently mounted around the outside of a wooden box with a power source and Adafruit Feather M4 Express tucked inside for ease of portability. The 4 LED matrices are 64x32 RGB LEDs with a 6mm pitch. We will be using bison/yacc to generate the parser. 


## Project goals: 

The goal is to design a language and implement a parser for it that will make it easy for lay people to learn how to program text for the matrices on the fly.
